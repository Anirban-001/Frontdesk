# Human-in-the-Loop AI Assistant - Complete Documentation



An intelligent voice assistant that demonstrates human-in-the-loop learning. The AI can call in human supervisors whenever required, learn from their responses, and build an automatic knowledge base over time.



---An intelligent voice assistant with human-in-the-loop learning, appointment booking, and automatic knowledge base building.This project uses a local virtual environment located at `.venv`.



## 🎯 What This System Does



**Core Concept: Human-in-the-Loop AI Learning**---Activation (Windows PowerShell):



This system demonstrates an AI assistant that:

- Answers customer questions from a learned knowledge base

- **Escalates unknown questions to human supervisors in real-time**## 🎯 What This System Does```

- **Learns from supervisor answers automatically**

- Handles appointments with automatic booking.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

- Provides natural conversation flow with timeout handling

- Builds knowledge base continuously through human feedback**AI Voice Agent** that:```



**Supervisor Web Interface** for:- Answers customer questions from learned knowledge base

- Managing help requests from AI

- Building and curating knowledge base- Books appointments automatically (Mon-Sat, 9am-6pm)Activation (Windows Command Prompt):

- Viewing appointment schedules

- Tracking system statistics- Escalates unknown questions to supervisors

- Rejecting inappropriate questions

- Learns from supervisor answers```

---

- Handles calls with natural conversation flow.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

## ✨ Key Features

- Provides hold music during waits```

### 1. 🧠 Human-in-the-Loop Learning (Core Feature)

- **AI Requests Help**: When AI doesn't know an answer, it calls human supervisor- Ends calls gracefully

- **Real-time Escalation**: Supervisor sees request immediately in web UI

- **60-Second Response Window**: AI waits up to 60 seconds for human answerIf the venv is missing, create it with:

- **Automatic Learning**: Every supervisor answer is saved to knowledge base

- **Continuous Improvement**: AI learns and handles similar questions independently next time**Supervisor Web Interface** for:



**How Human-in-the-Loop Works:**- Managing help requests```

```

Customer asks unknown question- Building knowledge basepython -m venv .venv

    ↓

AI searches knowledge base → Not found- Viewing appointment schedule```

    ↓

AI: "Let me check with my supervisor..."- Tracking system statistics

    ↓

Request appears in Supervisor UI- Rejecting inappropriate questionsAfter activation, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if present).

    ↓

Supervisor provides answer

    ↓---

AI delivers answer to customer

    ↓## ✨ Key Features

Answer saved to knowledge base

    ↓### 1. 🧠 Intelligent Knowledge Base

Next time: AI answers independently!- **Automatic Learning**: Every supervisor answer is saved and reused

```- **Fuzzy Matching**: Finds similar questions (50% word overlap)

- **Instant Answers**: No supervisor needed for repeat questions

### 2. 🧠 Intelligent Knowledge Base- **Manual Entry**: Supervisors can add Q&As directly

- **Automatic Learning**: Every supervisor answer is saved and reused

- **Fuzzy Matching**: Finds similar questions (50% word overlap)**How It Works:**

- **Instant Answers**: No supervisor needed for repeat questions```

- **Manual Entry**: Supervisors can add Q&As directlyCustomer asks question

    ↓

### 3. 📅 Appointment BookingAI searches knowledge base

- **Business Hours**: Monday-Saturday, 9am-6pm (Closed Sundays)    ↓

- **Time Slots**: Hourly appointments (9am, 10am, 11am... 5pm)Found? → Answer immediately

- **Auto-Validation**: Prevents double-booking and past datesNot found? → Ask supervisor → Learn answer

- **Confirmation**: Unique 8-character confirmation code```

- **Cancellation**: Supervisors can cancel with reason

### 2. 📅 Appointment Booking

### 4. ⏱️ Timeout Handling- **Business Hours**: Monday-Saturday, 9am-6pm (Closed Sundays)

- **Wait Time**: Up to 60 seconds for supervisor- **Time Slots**: Hourly appointments (9am, 10am, 11am... 5pm)

- **Graceful Exit**: Thanks customer and ends call if no response- **Auto-Validation**: Prevents double-booking and past dates

- **Background Monitor**: Tracks late responses- **Confirmation**: Unique 8-character confirmation code

- **SMS Notification**: Simulated text when supervisor answers late- **Cancellation**: Supervisors can cancel with reason



### 5. 📞 Call Management**Booking Flow:**

- **Natural Endings**: Detects goodbye phrases```

- **Auto-Termination**: Ends agent process cleanlyCustomer: "I want to book a haircut"

- **Room Cleanup**: Deletes LiveKit rooms properlyAI: "What date would you like?"

- **Trigger Phrases**: "goodbye", "that's all", "bye", "end call"Customer: "Monday November 10th"

AI: "Available times: 9am, 10am, 2pm, 4pm. Which works?"

---Customer: "2pm"

AI: "May I have your name and phone number?"

## 🚀 How to RunCustomer: "Sarah Johnson, 555-1234"

AI: "Booked! Confirmation: AaJ7rWMZ"

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Before Going Live:
1. ✅ Add authentication to supervisor UI
2. ✅ Implement real SMS (Twilio integration)
3. ✅ Set up logging and monitoring
4. ✅ Add rate limiting to prevent spam
5. ✅ Configure SSL/HTTPS
6. ✅ Set up database backups
7. ✅ Add error reporting (Sentry)
8. ✅ Performance monitoring
9. ✅ Load testing
10. ✅ Phone number verification

### Scaling Considerations:
- Use Firebase in production mode
- Add caching for knowledge base
- Implement connection pooling
- Use CDN for static assets
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Set up horizontal scaling

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Agent not answering:
- Check knowledge base has entries
- Verify Firebase connection
- Check API keys are valid
- Review terminal logs

### Hold music not playing:
- Verify audio output enabled
- Check volume level
- Ensure sample rate compatibility

### Appointments not booking:
- Check business hours configuration
- Verify date format is correct
- Ensure slot not already booked
- Check Firebase permissions

### UI not updating:
- Refresh browser page
- Check Flask server is running
- Verify port 5000 is not blocked
- Check browser console for errors

### Knowledge base not matching:
- Check fuzzy match threshold
- Verify question normalization
- Add more entries to knowledge base
- Review match scoring logic
